items: 
    - You finally have the villain at your mercy, but their child is with them. Are you willing to kill an innocent child's parent in front of their very eyes?
    - The village is going to be culled to prevent the spread of a terrible plague. Do you spare the villagers by preventing the cull at risk of millions of lives dying to plague?
    - The villain has framed you for a crime you didn't commit, but to resist arrest would make it more likely that your reputation as an outlaw sticks with you permanantly. Do you turn yourself in?
    - The wizard sent you on a simple errand: decomission his malfunctioning golem, but when you find the golem it is exhibiting obvious signs of sentience, and self awareness. Does it deserve the freedom of other sentient beings?
    - The villain shares a common goal/enemy with the party and suggests declaring a truce to deal with the situation. Do you work together with your sworn enemy?
    - You captured some enemy soldiers for information and have them at your mercy. Do you let them go and risk them giving away your position or slaughter the unarmed troops? 
    - Your party is guilty of a crime (arent they all at some point?) and the local law enforcement has arrested someone else for it. Do you turn yourself in and save the person, or do you let them try him so you can remain out of prison?
    - Your party is contracted to deal with a group of bandits that has been waylaying merchants on the road, miles outside of town. It turns out that the spoils of these robberies are being redistributed to the poor citizens. 
    - The villain is currently holding a hostage that the party hates but the public loves. 
    - The king, who has proven himself to be a great ally and a terrifying enemy, has charged you to escort a caravan of people to be sold into slavery 
    - A bottle of stolen mead has been found by the party after a merchant warns them to be on the lookout for it. However, the rare mead is unattended and probably worth a nice chunk of change. The party can either steal it, sell it, and tell the merchant what they did, lie about stealing it, return it to the merchant, or do nothing. If the party ends up stealing or returning the mead, a later quest will reveal it was honestly bought and that the merchant, now gone, is something of a scammer. 
    - You come to a crossroads and suddenly from the north a girl comes running down saying "please help....they are about to sacrifice my sister" And then a boy comes running up from the other direction "please help...my village is under attack" Helping the girl stop the sacrifice summons a demon but the sister is saved and the other village is slaughtered. Saving the village means the sister is sacrificed and the girl stalks the party waiting for her moment to strike to get revenge 
    - You see a bear following a child who was yelling in another language, if the party kill the bear, the girl runs backs to his werebear father while he is dying. 
    - Your sibling wants to ask hags/fiends for a cure to save your sick mother, but may have to commit some evil deeds in the process. 
    - A mad queen made a pact with a demon lord to always return from the dead, so long as her bloodline remains, some of her descendants may be some people you know... 
    - The party comes cross an infant gnoll, crying over the corpse of its dead parent. It may be an inherently chaotic and evil creature, but it is still youngdo they leave it, kill it, or try to help it? 
    - A local mimic wants to stop being used as furniture. Does the party kill it, or take pity and relocate the poor creature 
    - The party were the only witnesses to a child stealing something from a stall, but the city punishes stealing with death. If the party doesn't describe (and thus likely condemn) the child to death, the blame will fall on the only other possible thieves: themselves. 
    - A local lord and his knights have recently killed an adult dragon which had been terrorizing the surrounding lands for years. There's one last job: go to the dragons lair and exterminate it's clutch of eggs and the remaining wyrmlings. None can survive or the lairs effects on the region will never go away. 
    - There's a deadly and neigh-unbreakable curse that jumps from parent to biological child when the parent dies. The current curse bearer is a powerful wizard who keeps it at bay with ritual sacrifice of humanoids, using their souls to empower his resistance. The wizard has many children and dozens of grandchildren, and if he's killed, they'll quickly die from the inherited curse, them lacking his ability to resist it. 
    - A senile old wizard has been secluded in the mountains, summoning mass amounts of monsters to keep himself from being lonely. The monsters run away from him out of fear but savagely kill innocents. Does the party kill him to stop the killings or go to the trouble of trying to find help for him. 
    - There's a prophecy that a young child, descendant of a great hero, will be the gateway for a great demon to come back into this world by bursting out of the kid's chest. An evil wizard can get the demon out without harming the child, but the demon will be under the wizard's control. Do the heroes wait to see if the prophecy is false (it's not), enlist the help of the wizard and have to deal with that problem later, or murder the great-great-great-great grandchild of the man who saved the entire kingdom? 
    - Your party gets hired by a wealthy collector to transport an artifact purchased from the town over. When they arrive in the other town, they find out the artifact they are to transport is a little girl. 
    - A quest to go slay a nearby ogre is posted in a tavern. The ogre has no interest in hurting anyone but doesn't want to leave either. Gemstones poking out of the walls of the caves hint at why the bounty was placed. 
    - You are fighting your way to a dragon's lair through some surprisingly smart owl bears, shambling mounds, treants, and other typically dumb creatures. You learn that to destroy the dragon's (or other BBEG) power will be to rob all these creatures of their intelligence that they now prize so dearly. ( partially based on a post by )
    - A level in the dungeon is filled with monsters and deadly traps, but also cages filled with innocents in the way. If the party isn't careful they are likely to be killed. 
    - The local village is holding a firbolg named Thorbyrn prisoner, saying he killed one of the local guardsmen. The firbolgs have always been peaceful and all evidence suggests hes not the culprit. Heâ€™s to be executed in the morning and the party must decide if they will save him. 
    - A village is under the influence of a long forgotten goddess of Fertility who requires blood sacrifices to work her magic. Without the sacrifices, the crops are eaten by pests, die to diseases from the soil, or don't even make enough food for a small child. 
    - You've been called to kill a bunch of 'evil' creatures (goblins, orcs, whatever) but find that while they're not the best ever they're also the victims of discrimination and being kept out of 'honest' ways to make a living 
    - You receive a powerful magic item that perfectly fits in with your character's abilities, but are warned soon after earning it that the more you use it, the more that your morality will be corrupted. Will you use it or destroy it? 
    - You've come across a group of revolutionary inventors, they've created things that will change the path of history for the better. You find out they've invented everything sacrificing innocent, unwilling, lives in the testing process. Do you stop them? 
    - You come across a prisoner and a guard. The prisoner claims to be a person of good who is being held unjustly while the guard claims the prisoner is evil. ( inspired by )
    - There's a secret group of werewolves among the people in a small village. They've been feeding on livestock; however, they are also responsible for keeping the monsters in the surrounding area at bay. The villagers want their livestock safeguarded, but the werewolves are desperate to remain a secret so they can be with their families. 
    - The party has slain the evil tyrant, and freed the kingdom, but discovered that the reason the tyrant ruled so harshly was to prepare the kingdom to fight against an even greater threat.

    - You're in a cave, a rockslide has blocked the flow of an underground river, a huge beastie is coming down the tunnel and suddenly unleashing a river in it's face is the best way to deal with it, but a gnome has built a house in the way and his wife is sick in bed 
    - a magic mcguffin is very important to the survival of a town, you learn that a criminal gang are planning to steal it and they're recruiting new members to assist. A perfect opportunity to infiltrate and save the town, except the mcguffin would be really useful to your master quest.
