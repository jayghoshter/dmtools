  - You swear that something is moving out of the corner of your eye.
  - You have mild insomnia. Sometimes a rest does nothing for you. (roll of 1 or 20 on a d20)

  - You intermittently hear an invisible, live-studio audience, who react accordingly to your actions, as if you were an actor in a sitcom from decades past.

  - You begin to misquote famous people you've never heard of. As the great William Shakespeare once said, "There ain't no meat as good as human meat."
  - Everything around you looks like flesh. People are big, talking mounds of meaty flesh. You don't seem to mind though, as far as you know, everyone else always looked like that. (Partially inspired by Saya no Uta)
  - You _think_ you develop a knack for writing or painting bleak works of art. Meaning, you try your best, but the insanity grants no positive modifiers on checks to actually make the work of art. (Inspired by Kyle from high school)

  - You constantly have a meandering, wandering tune stuck in your head, and incessantly hum or whistle it constantly. You can force yourself to stop, but after a minute or two your hands will start shaking uncontrollably until you start humming or whistling again.
  - You have an innate sense of servitude. When someone commands you to do something that doesn't obviously put you or your friends in danger, you'll instinctively follow it for a moment or two before coming to your senses. Let's hope your party or enemies don't take advantage of this!
  - A permanent st-st-st-stutter.
  - You constantly make spoofy goonerisms- DANG IT! I meant goofy spoonerisms. (When you mix up the first letter of woo twords- DANG IT!)

  - If you don't trim your toenails to the quick every few hours they'll start growing out of control.

  - Some spy is always watching you, your every step, your every action, and everyone in your knows it but pretend they don't to drive you crazy. Except there is no one.
  - You are convinced you and none you know are real, only puppets ins ome sick tabletop game played by real people elsewhere, but no one else seems to realize this.
  - You are the god of / the letter H. / the number 6. / the word "Archway." / small, flightless birds. / Anyone who deposes you is evil and worth a duel to unconciousness.

  - Each time you intend to say a number, add 1 to that number.
  - You need to be standing next to PARTYMEMBER at all times
  - Any yes or no question must be answered incorrectly. You do not realize that you're doing this and will deny that you're doing it.
  - No object permanence. If the enemy is not visible, the enemy is gone. If the party is behind you, they no longer exist. You cannot comprehend that this is not true.
  - Time has no meaning. If anyone explains anything in time, you decide that you need to do it immediately or never. You cannot explain why you do this.
  - The first object you see is now your friend, lover, and mate. You would do everything for this object and must hold it in at least 1 hand. Pick your object now.

  - Extreme fear of heights
  - There's a cold draft across the back of your neck. "_DAMMIT! Would somebody close the windows!"_
  - You sing the first three words of every sentence. At least that's what people say you do, but you know you don't. These people are crazy.
  - You have an extreme phobia to green paint. For example, a portrait of a horse in a field (_green painted grass!!!_) is wholly traumatizing to you.
  - You swear up and down that every footstep you take sounds like you're walking on dry, crunchy leaves. "_How do none of you hear that??!_"
  - Why does everyone seem to have these little pests in the hair? Surely they won't mind if you pick them out for them.
  - You constantly hear a mosquito flying around your ear. However, the annoying little sh- bug always seems to stop whenever you pay attention to it
  - You develop a fondness for fire. It's just so beautiful, so entrancing... and you must have more of it. Roll a d20 to resist the urge for arson (probably determined by DM), or you can choose not to resist.
  - There are strange shadowfolk that lurk in the corners of your vision. No one else seems to see them, but you do. And they're coming for you. It's only a matter of time.
  - Your "reflection" is actually your long-lost twin. They gave their life to keep you outside the mirror dimension and are now trapped there.
  - Every couple of hours, you must complete a strange ritual to keep you and the entire party safe. Eg: throw salt over every party member, paint everyone's forehead with the blood of their fallen enemies after combat, shake strange herbs over everyone while murmuring a seemingly nonsensical chant, fill everyone's pockets with bat wings and iron fillings, etc.
  - You see the spirits of old objects. The older they are, the stronger the spirit, and thus the longer you can converse with them. They're usually very nice and great conversationalists. You think they must be lonely when they have so few people to talk to.

  - You always feel just a bit too cold/hot
  - You can never feel truly clean
  - You lose the ability to write in one random language you know (you retain the ability to read and speak it) and you gain the ability to write on random language you don’t (you can’t read or speak the new language)
  - Numbers have consciousness. And they are changing. For example; Everbody says 2+2=4 but you heard the numbers talking and they decided to change that equation. So it is 2+2=5 now and only you know it.
  - When in crowds and populated settings, you briefly catch glimpes of people who have died. You sometimes double-take, or quietly think, "It couldn't possibly be them. They passed away years ago...didn't they?"
  - You have an itch somewhere on your body that is never satisfied.
  - You have a constant feeling that you’ve forgotten something, and it’s driving you mad trying to remember what it is.
  - You have forgotten the basic rules of multiplication and division.
  - You believe shadows are out to kill you

  - You believe there is someone out to kill you for a crime you never committed
  - You begin to hallucinate once a day a strange demonic goat figure that seems to laugh at you
  - You feel like you have a serious illness that is killing you despite not having it
  - There is a new party member, Gary. He seems to only like talking or interacting with you socially- but you get it- some of these other party members take a bit to warm up to. He doesn't seem to be much of a help in combat- but he sure does try his hardest, and you gotta admire him for that! A good guy, Gary sure is. (Gary does not exist, obviously.)
  - You are suddenly very worried about something happening to your \[external body part\] in combat. You are VERY interested in extra ways to protect this area, through custom armor, spells, enchantments, or anything that helps. That part of your body cannot be protected enough!
