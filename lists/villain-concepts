pick: 5
items:
  - A black dragonborn warlord with part of his face melted away by acid to reveal muscle and sinew, kinda like Two-Face. Perhaps this was due to a deformity in his draconis fundamentum, that made his acid breath hard to control, or vice versa. Perhaps this was the work of a rival that he vowed to one day destroy. Maybe he hides this deformity behind a mask or visor, or broadcasts it to his victims, terrifying them before their inevitable demise.
  - A teifling assassin, cursed with hard-to-control teleportative powers, that had the tip of his tail cut off. He replaced it with a poisoned war barb, to whip around and stab people with, and learned to control his power and use it to his advantage. His name? The Nightcrawler. (I’d recommend giving him misty step as a bonus action.)
  - An Oblex that lives in the town’s sewers, puppeting the townsfolk
  - An insane doppelgänger con artist with a complex Scooby-Doo-esque plan in mind
  - A reclusive but kind old wizard-druid who loved animals and nature, and lived in the catacombs under a small village’s chapel. Despite his creepy home he was well loved among the villagers, and often helped the clerics tend to the wounded and sick. One day he stopped turning up above ground. People say he had been studying something he refused to talk about. Unbeknownst to the village, the man had discovered a book of dark magic and arcane research. The book slowly started to corrupt the old man’s mind as he tryed to learn its secrets, and with it his goals and means to achieve them. Years later, the catacombs have been sealed up for decades, and everyone thinks he’s dead, but some say they hear, now and again, tapping noises. Someone... or something... is digging!
  - A bandit lord that’s been experimenting with hemomancy (blood magic) to create unethical new spells
  - A False Hydra
  - A crazy gnomish artificer that designed (and now haunts) a Death Trap Manor (bonus points if it has rooms that move like a Rubik’s Cube)
  - An awakened farm animal seeking to spark a revolution and have its revenge on its handlers
  - A kind old wizard, possibly with memory problems, who unknowingly became a lich. The PCs are sent on a noble quest to slay the evil Lich-King, and find this old man that wants to help them. Later they come across the Lich’s lair, only to find out the old man is the lich.
  - As an added twist, all the evil stuff said to have been done by the aforementioned “Lich-King” or his minions, is actually being done by a dragon or other villain trying to frame the old wizard. The wizard, after the realization HE’S the lich, and there’s no way he would do this stuff, helps the players defeat the real BBEG.
  - The Black Swan, Your players have been hunted by (or were hunting) this legendary assassin for a while now. Perhaps they were employed by the BBEG, perhaps they sought revenge for a past slight, etc., etc. But whatever the reason, it’s all come down to this... The sky sparkles with stars over the cityscape, a crisp night-air breeze drifts from the open window. There is an unnatural whoosh of air. One player stirs in his sleep, opening a single eye. It widens in horror as the tall siloheutte fills the window. The figure’s wings flare, looking every inch an angel of death as it’s plague doctor-like mask scans the room. Beady black eyes glint from behind the mask, the knife gleaming in the moonlight... Two of them are dead before they even draw their weapons, and the rest are quickly and brutally dispatched... The last one struggles to get up, but his calf was slashed horribly. In desperation he seizes a lantern and smashes it in front of him, setting a fire between him and the assassin before swinging the shattered lantern at their mask’s beak... the assassin takes the blow unflinchingly, the glass shards tearing a gash across it. As the mask falls to tatters into the flame, the adventurer recoils at the sight of his killer’s true visage, that of a beautiful white swan. The mask’s “beak” was a real beak. A swan aarockroa. As the adventurer drifted into unconsciousness, the Black Swan tore into his flesh, beak and blade working in unison, he manages to utter, “You aren’t black...” ...A drunkard stumbles out of a nearby pub, as he looks up from vomiting, he spots a black shape moving across the sky, just as he passes out he hears the words “Fire! Fire on the top floor! Fire!”.... (Sorry for the creepypasta, this is just how I visualize this villain going about things. If you want my advice, have a mystery; someone’s been brutally murdering adventurers all over the city, the building’s they’re found in burned down.)
  - A humble peasant that fights off adventurers that think they can just tramp all over his land take what they want. The more and more adventurers he just manages to defeat, the bigger the stockpile of magic items, weapons, loot, etc. from them he collects. More and more adventurers come to get this growing pile of loot, and Humble Peasant is forced to build up defenses, tame rare creatures as guards, make traps, etc. Eventually he realizes he’s created the ultimate dungeon and no one will ever leave him alone now. Cue mid-life crisis.
  - A Triton Tidecaller/Mage, who has succumbed to the whispers of the Lurkers in the Deep. Now they seek the downfall of the Triton Kingdom to further their Masters Plans.(Underwater Adventures need love too.)
  - A Eladrin Rogue, who has worked for several Enemies of Party, but always manages to get away and is incredibly smug about it. They just enjoy killing beloved NPCs and cause property damage.
  - A Hobgoblin Warlord Artificer, who has equipped his soldiers with all kinds of Steampunk-Gear. They is hoping for World Domination(although a decent sized city would be a good start), while working on their biggest Projekt, An Iron Colossus.

  - A Goblin Masterthief who leads the towns Thieves Guild. Thanks to their discrete Methods of communication, almost the entire guild doesn't know their Leader is the proprietor of the "Stone Sheep" Inn by the town gates.
  - A Copper Dragonborn Town Guard who takes bribes and works together with the Thieves Guild. They do this purely for the money.
  - A Duergar Mercenary Captain who works for any villian who can pay their prices. They are exiled royalty of his people and wants to amass riches to prove themselves.
  - A horrifically ugly half elf Sorcerer. She has a crooked noise, terrible skin, patch hair, etc. She is absolutely obsessed with beauty and uses magic to charm individuals she finds beautiful to follow her and worship her for her beauty. She often walks around with glamours and will go great lengths to avoid seeing herself.

  - A changeling serial killer named “Smiler.” They exclusively kill servants of the good aligned gods and then dress up and pose their bodies in a way that mimics that god’s physical description. The twist is that the mask they wear (white porcelain, vacuous eyes, unnaturally wide smile) actually contains the personality of Smiler and the changeling is an unwitting host. Smiler is actually a serial killer from ages past who served one of the demon lords and whose soul now inhabits the mask. They attempt to fully possess anyone who finds it or tries to use it thus continuing their killing spree across centuries.
  - A priest of a forgotten god, who's Family used to live in luxury, being the vhosen ones of said god. Their whole Town got destroyed by extremists of another Religion in their past, and prayig to their god is now forbidden.

The local deity ist the one of the extremists who burned down the priests home, and they long for vengence.

Every person in the small village they are in got marked with an invsible rune, and will be sacrificed once the ritual is complete.

  - a powerful religious group which is slowly falling into evil. They have churches and followers everywhere and even the country’s ruler is an adherent. Gradually, their methods and tactics become more and more vicious and bloody. Has their god become corrupted or are there darker force at work within the church?
  - a sentient and predatory “leak” from the Far Realms that seems to be doing what it can to expand and force its way into the Material Plane. It’s normally invisible/undetectable due to its abnormal physics at work, but its influence can be seen in warped objects, mutated people and animals, unnatural growth of weird plants and fungi. Think “Color Out Of Space” but with an agenda
  - a fallen godling or demigod whose followers were on the losing end of a religious inquisition. It no longer has the income of faith necessary to keep it as a deity and desires that more than anything. It’s willing to do whatever is necessary to get back to Celestia.
  - an artificer/cleric of a mechanical deity who has figured out the way (special prayers/words in a lost language) to hack the Modron hivemind and ultimately reality itself

  - Scratches, a Cranium Rat Swarm who taunts the players telepathically, refuses to leave highly populated areas, and refuses to expose more than one or two rats at a time. It uses Command and Dominate Monster to make life miserable for the party, and thinks honorable combat is stupid crazy talk. It dominates guards into attacking the party, arrest them, etc. It dominates people into assaultring them or accusing them of crimes. It Commands nearby people to strike at them or scream or dive into harms way, anything to cause problems, hurt people or the party, all the while calling them fools for not joining the collective under its illithid masters.
  - A military general leading a medium sized militia. Not happy with the outcome of a war years past, they plan to “finish” a battle that’s already over.
  - The leader of a deadly cult. He has convinced hundreds to sacrifice themselves to a false god, and he plans to convince thousands more.
  - A simple baker, who sells poisoned food to the townsfolk. Whether through dumb luck or their own genius, it’s almost impossible to trace the string of illnesses back to them.

  - The Black Winged Maiden - This beautiful black winged Aasimar had his sense of justice distorted by the BBEG and see herself as the savior of the this world (because of her wings or just for being an Aasimar) and see the PCs (or PC) as impostors that should be eliminated. She even could be arrogant with normal people, but she should be very obsessed with the PC (s). In my campaign she was the nemesis of a PC and a very good lancer user. Also made her wings a bit more powerful, granting not only a very good mobility but also a extra defense.

Following him is The Church of the Fallen Lord, which is a murderous cult dedicated to fulfilling Syl'as' every whim. However, Syl'as does not want to be followed by them because he does not want the blood of innocents on his hands. He will not attack anyone until they express themselves as openly hostile towards him
