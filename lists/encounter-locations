type: list
pick: 10
items:
  - On a grand staircase
  - A narrow spiral staircase
  - Fight next to/in a shallow pool of water
  - A narrow alley with enemies on/in the adjacent buildings
  - On the rooftops of a dense city
  - Among piles of debris that can be used as cover or projectiles
  - Large pipes running through the area make some areas difficult for larger characters to enter, may gush hot steam when damaged.
  - The area is filled with hanging nets that can be climbed and hamper charges
  - The floor is delicate, and will collapse under too much weight or strain
  - In a carriage/cart/vehicle pursuing another
  - A shallow stream that may knock characters off balance
  - An icy cliff face, impeding movement
  - Floating islands, near enough to jump between
  - In the middle of traffic/ an uncontrollable stampede of animals. Lots of catastrophic elements rushing by at fast speeds.
  - In a network of elaborate, WWI-esque trenches with tight corners
  - In a room that shifts gravity every time someone touches a wall.
  - A raised platform above a pool of acid/lava that grows smaller as the fight wears on.
  - A moving fight that takes place atop two carriages speeding down narrow streets at twilight. Players can jump between carriages, and risk being trampled under foot below.
  - A lush river the players are riding a riverboat down. Ambushes from either side make for great tension and atmosphere.
  - In the hall at the foot of a great Kingâ€™s throne. Hamlet-style duels take place here.
  - In the auditorium and on the stage of a dilapidated theatre, the performances long gone. Seats, set pieces, and the great chandelier make for great projectiles or cover (depending on what you need)
  - In and around the skeletal remains of an enormous aquatic beast, killed centuries ago.
  - In the middle of the kitchen of the most famous restaurant in town...in the middle of dinner rush.
  - A mad duke's palace where the furniture attacks/trips/bull rushes you.
  - In the middle of a battlefield frozen in time. Or perhaps even moving ever so slowly, only moving every 3 rounds or so. You can still pick up any weapons lying around, and any creature you touch jumps to your time for the duration of contact. What once was a statue is now a potential ally, but only so long as you maintain contact.
  - On a step well (such as Chand Baori in India)
  - On the face of a sheer cliff, with small ledges, hanging ropes, and dangling rope bridges that were cut in the previous scene
  - In a menagerie of agitated animals, which may lash out at anything that gets too close to their cages
  - On a flying carpet flanked by a bunch of magic brooms
  - In an astral void filled with objects unfortunately lost via the interaction of a Bag of Holding and a Portable Hole
  - In a crowded alley marketplace
  - In and around the floating, geometric mental constructs of a slumbering archwizard's mind, a la M.C. Escher.
  - Back and forth through a portal connecting two wildly different areas
  - On a platform strapped to the back of a huge beast
  - Inside a museum of expensive art or artifacts, and you have to pay for anything that gets broken
  - Narrow planks criss-crossing a smelly bog
  - Inside a Hobbit hole... Mind the low ceilings!
  - In a mushroom forest where stray shots can knock loose some very interesting spores
  - Inside a room of shifting walls (like the "Traffic Jam" board game, but without trying to slide a piece off the board)
  - Inside a vault piled high with mountains of coins and treasure, which are surprisingly unstable
  - Inside a room that keeps getting hotter unless someone commits to holding open a vent or hatch or lever of some kind
  - In a hedge maze
  - On the back of a potentially hostile titan
  - A mansion where each chamber has a different center of gravity. First room is normal, then the bedroom has you walking on the ceiling, dining room has it forced on one of the walls, etc.
  - On a train/lighting rail, where enemies are inside, on top, and even underneath.
  - A chamber that's carved to amplify sound. Stealth is nearly impossible, loud noises become deafening etc.
  - A beacon or other bright light in the room, that cannot be looked at directly without being temporarily blinded
  - Atop a tower in a storm, where the wind and rain make difficult to see and hear, as well as hampering ranged attacks and movement
  - A great beast slumbers nearby, and neither side if the fight wants to have it woken up and have to face its ire.
  - Sharp spikes line the walls, injuring those who are pushed against them.
  - The ground is a cloying mire, and anyone who doesn't move at least 5 feet on their turn starts to sink
  - In the belly of a gigantic beast that is moving. This sloshes the stomach acid about. Stay atop the many pieces of floating debris and avoid splashes and falling in or you take damage.
  - Atop an ancient, vine-covered ziggurat that is crumbling with age.
  - Atop flying vehicles in a chase through a bustling sci-fi metropolis.
  - On the side of a steep hill in a rain storm with a mudslide triggered halfway thru.
  - In a snake pit.
  - In a china shop.
  - In the massive and complexly designed Imperial Gardens of a particularly unforgiving Empress whose greatest pride is her gardens.
  - In a huge magic library.
  - An extreme sports style obstacle course (a la Ninja Warrior, Gladiators, etc).
  - A burning tower.
  - A crashing airship.
  - Among tar pits or hot springs.
  - A fully automated factory assembly line. Added wrinkle, it is for making chemical ammunition.
  - Unstable rocky slope that could result in shifting stone if not a landslide
  - On top of a slow moving landslide that is stable enough to walk on, but occasionally a crack forms or a tree topples.
  - On a melting glacier with small puddles, slippery terrain, and deep cracks in the ice
  - A sinking desert ruin where streams of sand fall from cracks in the ceiling
  - Inside an enormous hollow log that begins to roll if the weight inside is uneven.
  - Within a laboratory, stray hits can break experiments with unusual results
  - Crossing a rope bridge, that's easily damaged
  - Construction site of a temple, large machinery and large piles of rock can be used to your advantage
