pick: 10
items:
  - Assassination of opposition leaders by secrete police
  - Restricting ballot access for opposition candidates due to control over the registration bureaucracy (in particularly they claim the real signatures for candidate as fake, if it was individual candidate. For example some signature of my relatives were deemed fake too. If it was registration of the party, it happens that party with this name is already registered – the exact moment opposition bring documents on the registration the other party with the same name became registered or one of lesser pro-government party suddenly changes its name).
  - Proclaiming most active NGO and peaceful religious movements as terroristic organisations (in my country it was Jehovah's Witnesses – questionable people, but definitely not terrorists)
  - Illegality of peaceful protests without government's permission
  - Restricting of access of opposition to major media either through direct control of them, either by association with oligarchs that owns it or through administrative pressure on it.
  - Firing people who happened to be on anti-government demonstration from public sector jobs
  - Requiring people who works on public sector to send photo of your ballot during elections to your boss as a report that you truly vote on the elections.
  - Elections with only one candidate in the ballot (Here and lower, based on USSR, notably tyrannical)
  - Mandatory psychiatrical treatment for those who opposes the government too loud
  - Total ban on every oppositional literature, political, economical, philosophical and during certain periods even scientific that contradicts main regime ideology, making possible due to direct governmental control over all publishers. It can circulate only as "samizdat" – "self-published", manuscripts of the entire books. (Notably in USSR you could found manuscripts of "The Gulag Archipelago" by the code name "Mystery Island")
  - Disenfranchisement of voters unlikely to support the party. For example by requiring voters ID, which not everyone can obtain due to required money or some hidden legal mechanisms. 
  - Forced labor for prisoners. 
  - All/most foreigns sent to the concentration camps as potential spies. 
  - Deliberately vague laws applied selectively; any political criticism being considered "slandering of public figure", any criticism on the interpretation of dominant religion being considered "hate speech", etc. (with double standards). 
  - Prolonged arrest times; to effectively keep people in prison without a judicial resolution. 
  - Representation deterrents like having a high vote threshold for forming a group in parliament, or high number of signatures/prerequisites to start a political party. 
  - Undermining separation of power; giving executive body too much power on appointment/replacement of judges. 
  - State-mandated eugenics programs, from forced sterilization to outright extermination. Seems to be happening everywhere nowadays. 
  - Economic incentives for those that report political oponents. 
  - A beard tax or the equivalent, intended to oppress certain races, religions, or professions. It doesn't necessarily have to be beards (or a tax); for example, a tax based on weight as a way to oppress orcs; a "tax" aimed at bards requiring the purchase of a license in order to perform music in public; a "tax" on murder-hoboes requires all weapons to be surrendered at the city gates and then a fee must be paid (per weapon) to get them back. 
  - Alcohol is strictly forbidden except during state-sanctioned festivals; the ruling class uses these festivals as a way to relieve pressure when the people get too unhappy. 
  - Restrictions on what weapons can be carried in public. 
  - Appointment of 'morality police' to watch over either populations or members of government. 
  - Forced relocations of people to work specific, necessary areas of industry/production. 
  - When there's an opening in a public sector job (ministry, public agency, etc.) you compete with other applicants with a grade, made up of a nationwide written exam plus a face to face interview (oral exam if you will) with the bureaucrats. When the weight of the oral exam is too high, they can easily lower the total grades of merited applicants and increase that of their supporters or acquaintances. It's harder to document and make a formal complaint as opposed to a nationwide written exam graded by computers and optical forms. 
  - Outlawing abortion and running a state-funded orphanage which trains children from infancy to become soldiers or assassins from the overflow of unwanted children. 
  - Both publicly denouncing and secretly funding ultranational supremist groups that keep other organized crime syndicates in check. 
  - Restrict travel to common folk and state the promised system which the regime supports is working "but on the other side of the country". Soldiers or diplomats will not be stationed closed to their hometown and letters stating the truth on their front will be doctored and the person watched at best or used as grounds of treason and executed at worst. 
  - False flag attack lesser key points of power or public landmarks and use them as grounds to further invade or oppress a neighboring country or populous. 
  - Divide the population of the country to distrust anyone who is from a different group, spark small civil wars between the factions, and use the infighting as divide and conquer areas while the factions weaken one another. 
  - Use psychopathic prisoners as suppression forces for civilian populations who do not follow demands. 
  - Police/ guards and their families are paid/ coerced to protest dissenting businesses and organizations in the guise of civilians. 
  - A local gang is placed in charge of tax collection as they are considered more cost efficient. 
  - Water/ electricity is diverted to only one different block each hour to "protect the environment" and cut costs. 
  - As part of schooling the youth are expected to serve in the police or military for 3 full years after their senior year, as part of the "Practical and essential skills" program. 
  - The government and large organizations support each other in raising the cost of secondary essential services for civilians, such as education and medical. While offering government and militaries workers benefits that offset some of these costs. - this has been happening in America for a long time 
  - Not allowed to wear certain types of clothing. 
  - Forced to have a radio tuned to a station that spews propaganda. Turning it off is a crime 
  - Forced to collect human waste as fertilizer. Punished if you don’t have enough. It is often stolen by others 
  - Your grandfather or great grandfather did something the regime doesn’t like (such as owning land) therefore your social status will always be low. 
  - Marrying someone of lower social status means you adopt their lower status, enforcing strict de facto castes. 
  - If you defect, your family will be sent to labor camps. 
  - Common words you’d know elsewhere do not exist, such as “freedom”, “oppression”, and even words about bad things such as “trauma” because it’s illegal to be unhappy in the paradise in which you live. 
  - Food is taken from the provinces to the capitals. Can’t rebel if you’re always hungry. 
  - When a dear leader dies you must wail and cry. Not crying and being upset enough could get you punished severely. 
  - Xenophobic portrayal of other countries that discourages people from going there and seeing what the alternative to tyranny is. Combine this with state-promoted patriotism. 
  - Monogamy is law, except for the hand picked of the dictator, who are rewarded with men/women as concubines for their service. 
  - Paper and ink costs are extortionate. 
  - Secretly inciting violence so the leader can step in and save the day. Eg: sending monsters to attack a village so they/their team can be the ones who responded fast and well. 
  - soldiers can live in people's homes and spy on them for the crown (or whatever the leader is) 
  - guards can search people's homes without a warrant or reason 
  - extended or indefinite prison sentences 
  - staged trials to make someone guilty 
  - rigged juries or judges 
  - torture 
  - no balance in power, judicial supremacy 
  - Littering is punishable by death. Complaining about the regime or its laws is considered an act of verbal littering. (Yes, I know it's from Borderlands 2, but it's tyrannical and funny.) 
  - All citizens are required to serve a minimum of five years in the military upon reaching age of majority. Any attempts to dodge the draft will be punished by 100 lashes and summary execution via hanging. Exemptions extended only to the infirm, the disabled, and the children of viscounts and above. 
  - State-funded orphanages that assess the skills and potential of all children under their care whilst simultaneously brainwashing them into mindlessly loyal citizens. All children that show exceptional potential are sent to academies to bring out their full-potential, all others are sent to workhouses as cheap labor. 
  - Mandatory book burning 
  - You must go to a government office to petition for water, it is not hard and you get plenty of water but it does take a while
