  - A fist-sized glass bauble with beautiful coruscating coloured lights inside. Small threads of green light and sparks stream from the center towards any nearby living creatures, and the bauble rolls slowly towards the nearest of these. This often causes it to roll off tables, but it's remarkably tough and even landing on a stone floor does not seem to harm it.
  - A tiny roughly-bound book, found in the bathroom. It contains twenty pages of interesting facts about the world. Every time the book is opened, the contents change. They are almost always things that the reader does not yet know, and range from the useless ("In Helm's Hold, just past the entranceway, there is a rock with a perfectly circular hole in it") to the secret and potentially useful ("The wife of the guildmaster of the Baker's Guild of Neverwinter has taken a lover").
  - Two silver-and-brass stag beetles, encased in a glass case, which constantly battle each other

  - A mirror that only shows the back of the viewer.
  - A set of just black chess pieces that play by themselves. Always loses.
  - A large trunk that stores far more than it should, but no matter how neatly you pack it everything is jumbled together when you open it again.

  - Book of insults; Anyone opening the book sees an insult directed at them and needs to make a dc 15 charisma save or slam the book closed in annoyance

  - Glasses of synesthesia - can help you know what someone looks like if you hear them talking but cannot see them.
  - A slightly cursed item ... the Ever Burping Torch. Upon command, the EBT will emit normal volume burps continuously (including smells) until the user says the command word again.

  - A foot long piece of string that reacts to any slight breeze by swirling up into a tiny tornado, moving in an erratic pattern until it hits something, at which time it falls inert for 24 hours.
  - Goggles that appear to any onlooker as goggles of minute seeing (as in, seeing small details) but when the wearer dons them, they show in the upper right hand corner of the field of vision four illusory hour glasses, each measuring a different period. one minute, five minute, ten minute, and one hour. These can be reset by thought by the wearer.
  - A beautiful lapel pin in the shape of a feather that, when worn, will cause the wearer to be the target of errant bird poop at some point in the next three days. Once the wearer is hit, the pin wills itself free of the wearers garment to be lost and later found by another lucky person.
  - An small barrel filled with used wands, all labeled with the original spell and perhaps the date of creation.
  - A piece of jewelry filled with mystical energy, but no enchantment. Detect magic will tell you that it is filled with an incredible amount of power. Players will spend hours trying to figure out what it is, only to discover it's nothing. Maybe it was an experiment of the wizard to see how much magic it could actually hold, and he just got bored with it?
  - Ring of invisibility. when you put the ring on, it turns the ring invisible, not you.
  - A tiny mimic in a miniature set, which is entrapped in a thick glass case. It attempts to hide from any observers as a tiny piece of furniture. The wizard used it as a 3D "where's waldo" set.

  - A set of 5 mismatched tea cups. Each one can be tuned to a specific tea or drink poured into them, including sweetening and strength of brew. They will fill with that drink on command, once a day.

  - A broach that looks like a brass owl. When a command word is spoken it gives you a synopsis of everything that has been said near it in the last ten minutes.
  - A wall mounted bust of an elephants head. You can tell it to remind you of something in X days and it will. An elephant never forgets.
  - A small basket of enchanted clothespins. They were designed to keep clothes secure on the clothesline, but the spell ended up a little to strong. If clipped on a clothing item they cant be removed by physical means.
  - A tiny brass compass which can locate anything you have owned for at least a year and a day. It's currently pointing towards the wizard's slippers.
  - A tweed deerstalker hat which has a chance of making the nearest bird do slightly amusing things - flying upside-down, doing a little dance, skating down the side of a roof, and so on. The unusual behaviour happens on average once every five minutes.

The objects in the case always have a theme. small deep-sea molluscs, fragments of ancient weaponry, unusual keys, preserved insects, and so on.
  - A pair of boots with small wheels attached to them. When their heels are clicked together, the boots will glide forward at jogging pace. They're surprisingly smooth even over rough terrain.

  - A ring of clothing storage. On command, the wearer's clothing (including small magical items and pocket contents, but not including backpacks, armour or weaponry) will be teleported into a small pocket dimension, then restored upon a second command. The ring uses prestidigitation to replace the clothing perfectly on the wearer's body. Originally created by a wizard very fond of an early-morning swim, after his favourite robe was stolen from the river-bank by local youths.
  - A parchment scroll containing a newsletter from an unknown world. None of the people or places are recognisable from any accessible plane, and the level of technology and magic in this world seem slightly more advanced. The newsletter updates itself every day to reflect current effects.
  - A brass monkey which waves a small fan when tapped on the head. The fan is enchanted to provide a slight cooling or warming breeze, depending on the time of year.

  - An entire wall covered with miniscule glowing crayfish-like creatures. Several tanks dribble water down the wall to keep it constantly moist. The creatures work together to show images from around the world. beautiful sunsets, dungeons lit by phosphorescent fungus, bustling cities from the air.
  - A stool with two sinewy, multi-jointed hands and arms attached to it. When somebody sits on the stool, the hands explore their shoulders and back, then give them a massage. The hands will also attempt to play any musical instrument presented to them, but they're not very good at it.
  - A carved wooden hand on a stick. Waving the stick in the air while thinking of a person will result in them feeling a spectral tap on their shoulder. One charge per day.
  - A quill which always writes with beautiful copperplate handwriting, regardless of the wielder. It needs no ink, and the deep black lines it lays down are waterproof and shine with a subtle iridescence when held at the right angle.
  - A fireplace poker which gives control over any nonmagical fire - allowing a smouldering ember to be turned into a raging bonfire, or a burning room to be almost extinguished, leaving only a cosy fire in the grate. The poker requires fuel to work (so it could set a boat on fire, but not a stone-walled dungeon), it doesn't undo any damage caused by the fire, and can only affect fires up to thirty feet cubed.
  - A ring of holding, with a three inch cubed capacity. When found, it is full of tobacco ash and cigarette ends.
  - A jewelled bird in a golden cage, which sings songs about anybody nearby in a high clear voice. The songs praise the person's key attribute, and work in references to recent heroic deeds. The bird can be silenced by covering the cage with a cloth.
  - A small pebble which, when placed in an open area with nothing above it and the command word said, will propel itself into the sky at great speed with an ear-shattering bang. The sound of the pebble's passage can be heard for up to a mile around, and at night, the pebble can be seen glowing white-hot as it tears through the air. The pebble travels upwards for an entire minute, then falls to earth under normal gravity. The pebble will land somewhere within a mile of its launch site, depending on wind conditions. One charge per day.
  - A ticking pocket watch, which seems to be normal, but definitely has a magic aura. A strong one at that. It ticks until there are 24 hours left before the holder dies.
