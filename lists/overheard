  44:  "Dropped that ax on his foot. Took off three toes but he stood there screeching about his new boot…"
  45:  "...so I push this oddly thin orc and... I shit you not... he fell apart into three goblins and ran in different directions.."
  46:  What do you mean I remind you of MY mother!?!?
  47:  I’m told it’s the latest fashion but honestly does that make them worth the stench?

  52:  "...and I said unicorns don't even wear pants."
  53:  "Where did you find a blue antler at 3 in the morning?"
  54:  Had a dog once. Turns out it was just a creepy old Druid.

  62:  "If he comes back this way I'll stick a spear right in his gut. I ain't got no qualms about it neither."
  63:  "If it weren't for my horse I never would've gotten into college."
  64:  ".....those aren't children."
  65:  "Let me guess... someone stole your sweet roll."
  66:  "What do you call a group of owlbears, a sleuth or a parliament?"
  67:  "So help me Pelor, if Max makes one more 'I barely know her' joke, I'm gonna shove him face-first into the dirtiest latrine in the Hag and Hog!"
  68:  "The ale at the pub is too foamy because they don't pour it right! My mam always said, Don't be an ass, tilt the glass!"
  69:  ...was a good friend of mine. Never understood a word he said but I helped him drink his wine..
  70:  "... and they didn't know what to feed the damn thing, so they figured to just feed it nails and call it a day. By the way, you wouldn't happen to know someone in need of a dead ostrich, would you?"
  71:  .... and that is why you don’t eat the blue ones. 
  72:  "...No, it's not gay!"
  73:  ...and I haven’t swum since.

  79:  "You know, there are eyes on the moon"
  80:  "...and he used the strawberries as a distraction and jumped through the window. And the mayor didn't even see him!"
  81:  Lucky for us, the wizard lit the pinecones on fire, and we hurled them at the dire wolves that had chased us up the trees!
  82:  Can we not talk about that incident in the graveyard?
  83:  You did **what** with a fire elemental?
  84:  "And so I told him, Mate, you’re just a post-birth abortion waiting to happen. Shit really hit the cyclone after that."
  85:  "Nobody talk about those damn chickens okay?"
  86:  "... and, of course, the invisibility spell had to pick _that_ specific moment to wear off, and me without even a towel to cover myself with. And that's the story of how I ended up getting my head and ass kicked in by the women's rugby team."
  87:  "You really thought it would be a good idea to hire a _bard_ for your daughter's 18th birthday? Especially one with _his_ reputation?"
  88:  "...why do so many of your spells involve tentacles?!"
  89:  "Hey, you. Wanna buy a sundial?"
  90:  "... and then I said 'Wrecked'em? Damn near killed'em!' Get it? ... ah, you guys wouldn't know a joke if it bit ya."
  91:  "... I guess, in a way, kobolds are kinda like Dragonborn halflings. Not that I'd ever say that within earshot of a Dragonborn, however."

  93:  "And I'm-a telling you, the world, she is not-a flat-a. She's a round, she's a firm-a, she's a fully-packed-a! _She's-a round, LIKE-A MY HEAD!!!_"
  94:  ...we’re halfway through when I open a door and frogs. Everywhere.
  95:  ...’ oh no, Mr. Bigshot Wizard is gonna curse me! Ha!’ ZAP! And that’s why I’m married to a cow.
  96:  Wait, they regenerate?
  97:  ...it was so cute too, he even had a bucket on his head for a helmet. I still walloped him after I fished him out of the well though.
  98:  "...Curr, I am Zote the Mighty knight of great renown. Surely you have heard of me! You simply must give me, Zote the Mighty Knight of great renown, free drinks!"
  99:  "Say you put it atop your house, would you become a god?"
  100:  ...but I had to put that life behind me. Too much glamour and fame in candlemaking, and I just wanted to settle down. The ladies it brought, though... my goodness, the ladies.
