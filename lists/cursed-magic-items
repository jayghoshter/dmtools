The first effect is that the bearer can instantly know where a lich hid their phylactory as long as they have seen the lich. The second effect is that the bearer can concentrate on a hostile creature. Once they have concentrated on the hostile creature they can see it or sense the presence of within 100 feet of them for 3 seconds the glass figurine will light a fire within itself in the color of the bearers soul (this color is whatever the bearer can choose for it to be) and then drop the soul of artifice. When the item is shattered the bearer can make any saving throw they choose at advantage and the creature targeted must do the same without advantage. Neither creature can have disadvantage on the saving throw and the targeted creature cannot gain advantage on the saving throw. Neither creature can reroll their saving throw. Before the soul of artifice hits the ground all curses from both creatures are lifted and any legendary resistances are used up. Once the soul of artifice hits the ground it shatters and can never be used again. The creature who rolled lower on their saving throw instantly dies and their soul is destroyed in the process making it so they can never be resurrected.
