  - They are unrepentantly evil, but their personal definition of evil is so mild that they’re basically just jerk-neutral.
  - They are honor bound to serve one party member, or the group as a whole.
  - The party paid them for their expertise, on the condition that they did not commit criminal acts in the meantime.
  - They are evil in ways that have no bearing on their interactions with the party, such as corruption, or contacts in the thieves guild. The party’s quest is just another source of income.
  - They just like the party. It’s possible that they main even turn good as a result.
  - He/she is evil but not too evil so he still wants this world to survive.
  - Players has been secretly in love with one of the other party members or one of the party’s allies, but is socially awkward and wants to use the party as an excuse to spend time with them.
  - One of the other party members has a unique skill or talent that interests the player, and player wants them to teach it.
  - Player was assigned to the party to do community service as punishment for their crimes.
  - The evil player is a huge troll who pretends to be terrible at everything but is really just throwing for their own amusement.

  - He sees the party as bodyguards to help him rise to power.
  - I am way safer with this group of 'holier than thou's then I ever was with those other evil nut jobs. I'll stick with them until I can break of with my share/all of the loot.
  - Look, I admit, I'm not the most morally pure person there is but I'd like a, you know... world-that-exists.
  - In order to become the BBEG, first you must rid the world of the current BBEG.
  - I thought of an evil character who travels with a party but their end goal when the party is powerful is to somehow sacrifice everyone (including themselves) to some evil god or being.
  - One of the protagonists is their sibling/naive best friend/significant other and if the idiot is going to go risk their neck helping people, somebody with sense has to keep them safe.
  - Because there's not enough good people to fight evil and it is through conflict that the maximum amount of chaos can be done.
  - To make friends then betray them for more power.
  - Troubled Amnesia: they forgot who they are and begin a path of unknown redemption then, start to remember their old path.
  - To corrupt the party members.
  - To appease their patron.
  - The evil guy believes all adventurers now a day just die stupidly and is looking for a group that can survive the odds so eventually he can return to his evil ways and know there is someone out there that will try to stop him. As a bonus he is openly honest with the group as to his plan to help them become stronger for this exact reason.
  - To discretely raise funds for a coming invasion. (Studded leather armor costs 45 GP and a long sword is 15 GP per the PHB, so 60 GP would be enough for a basic warrior. A character with 20k GP would be able to field around 335 basic warriors, enough to pose a thread to a barony or a minor kingdom.)
  - Lost a bet. (works for lawful evil but not chaotic evil)

  - The evil player was forced by a council of celestial wizards to join a good party. He must join as penance for his sins and regain his honor.
  - The evil player wants to join the good party to avoid being captured by some enemies that are hunting him down. He is trying to hide from them.
  - The evil player wronged a bbeg. The bbeg tells all the other evil heroes and humiliated him among the evil realms. Because of this the evil player can’t join their parties for fear of being killed or further humiliated. He joins the party to have people to adventure with and to make his living.
  - The party could be useful assets, either proven by action or fortold by prophecy.
  - The party is a hinderence to the evil PC's boss and they're tasked with reporting progress or slowing them down, generally being a double agent.
  - A vision of the future involved the party or its member(s) and the evil PC wishes to learn more or interfere (perhaps unwittingly allowing the vision to come to pass).

  - Common goal, common enemy, very lazy.
  - Need money to do evil stuff.
  - They think the party is in the long haul helping evil via their sheer incompetence.
  - To hide from those who are searching for the evil character. No one would expect the evil character to be traveling with good characters.
  - To help the good guys take out the evil characters competition.
  - Just need the extra bodies to survive going through the dungeon. Dungeon contains something the evil character is looking for.

  - Their gang turned on them and they need protection.
  - Can't take over the world with competition.
  - To build up a 'good' reputation to get behind the sceences and rule the town, village, city, ECT. Eventually useing that reputaion to get people to do vaguely questionable things and slowly build the up into committing crime. (Think cult leaders)
  - To steal all their stuff. (I do mean "all," by the way, and that can include reputations, skin, souls.... or maybe just anything of any value at all including their pants)
  - They want to change.
  - They need to understand what drives the other side.
  - They need access to certain resources.
  - There isn't much of a network for evil people and the world is a big bad place.
  - The enemy of my enemy.
  - There is an unfortunate misunderstanding regarding the definition of "evil." I mean it's not like they're eating the children they kill.
  - The rest of the team isn't as "Good" as they claim. This character is just more honest than the rest of them.
  - Has very low morals. Not mustache-twisting evil, just a major prick with no concept of civil discussion.
  - Wants a legal excuse to kill stuff.
  - Greedy like a dragon and wants to horde as much wealth as possible, sees adventuring as the best method available.
  - He was hired by the party thinking their motives are different.
  - He hired the party thinking their motives are different.
  - Is an immortal/long lived race and wants to see the world before he burns it with legions of (possibly undead) minions.
  - They need to get somewhere dangerous or infiltrate some organization, and are teaming up with strong good-aligned people to do so.
  - You know you can finish your dinner in a tavern without having to flee the guards or an angry mob because of something one of the other party members has done. I mean, sure, they can be kind of insufferable about helping the downtrodden, but they don't murder barmaids or set magic stores on fire.
  - You have a great evil plan but you are not very experienced and dont have great means so you decided just pretending to be a goodguy for a while would help with both.
  - The evil guy realises a hero's job is to make themselves redundant by the world no longer needing hero's and is trying to convert them based on this theory.
  - The evil guy hires the party for a job and he get attached to them during the adventure and even though he is evil this doesn't make him an assholes and he actually gets on quite well with the party, sometimes he would just have preferred to kill the child that was trying to steal from the party rather than be outvoted to help the kid.
  - For Clerics and Paladins: I failed my God in some way, so they punished me most harshly, I must aid the forces of good for a time to atone.
  - To use the good party members as a cover in order to better hide from the authorities. Who would suspect the altruistic travelers of all those murders....
  - Plan to sacrifice those good members as part of a dark ritual.
  - Gain intel on potential threats posed by the the good aligned party and their allies.
  - Remove a stronger evil rival/threat from power. The enemy of my enemy is my friend afterall.
  - They share interests in common.
  - A common enemy. How could he conquer the world if the big bad wants to destroy it?
  - Because good is necessary, a story always has two sides.
  - Needs a position of trust to complete their goals.
  - Said evil character has a grudge or seething hatred against the BBEG, and this group of heroes can help with that.
  - They've got plate armor payments to make, and the money's good.

  - The character is too weak to travel alone and uses the pcs as a means to reach an area they are traveling to.

  - Evil player wants to exploit the secrets of a famous dungeon that the good players are about to explore.
  - To kidnap their cute new kitten.
  - Evil player lost a duel to good player. Good player spared evil player (of course). Evil player pledged service for a time.
  - Evil player joined the party for a circonstantial reason and found himself really liking his companions, and now he disagrees about a lot of things but has too much relatinship inertia to quit the group, it pains him very much.
  - Wants to be elected as head executive of a nation or exercise a claim on the throne, and knows it would go over better if he saved the city/republic/kingdom/world once or twice.
  - As a necromancer, holy magic is a constant threat to their work. So by adventuring with some divine champions of righteousness (and keeping the whole raising the undead thing under wraps for now), they can study holy power, note what seems effective against it, and develop appropriate countermeasures. May or may not involve “active experimentation” with the party in the form of surprise hordes of undead that, while attacking unexpectedly, only come when the party is mostly if not fully prepared/rested.
